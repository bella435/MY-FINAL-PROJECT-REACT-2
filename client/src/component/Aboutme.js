        <p>Growing up in a country with limited access to technology 
            sparked my curiosity and passion for computers. 
            I became fascinated by technology's capabilities, 
            which led me to pursue a bachelor of science degree in computer science BS. 
            When I took my first programming class in Java it was very challenging 
            but with the help of my teachers, I learned the programming fundamentals 
            and discovered my real passion for tracing an Algorithm and programming it.

        Currently a Computer Science major as well as an intern representative of the Department 
        of Education Technology Support. These help me I have honed many valuable skills."</p>
